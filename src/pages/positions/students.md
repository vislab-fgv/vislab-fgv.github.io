# Fellowship for Master's and Doctoral students in Data Science at FGV/EMAp, Brazil

The Visual Data Science Laboratory (http://visualdslab.com/) of the School of Applied Mathematics of the Getulio Vargas Foundation opens various research positions for multiple projects. The selected candidates will work at the School of Applied Mathematics of the Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation, located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under the supervision of Professor Jorge Poco.

## PROJECT 1: Data-driven Intelligence for Urban Crime Analysis and Perception

_Funded by FAPESP_

This project aims to create a framework using machine learning and data visualization to exploit big data already collected by security agencies. We will create tools that serve government agencies to make decisions and inform the general population. We have three main goals:

1. Acquire socioeconomic, infrastructure, and crime appearance data and estimate frequency in different city neighborhoods
2. Study its relationship to predict new crimes and estimate the perception of safety
3. Create visual tools to help experts understand the patterns

**Available Positions:**

- 3 Direct Ph.D. positions (NO prior master's required)

## PROJECT 2: Evidence-based monitoring and prediction of forest degradation and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon

_Funded by FGV/EMAp_

This project proposes a data science-based approach to tackle the inefficient mechanisms to track the boundaries between pastures and forests, the difficulty of identifying illegal logging sites, and the lack of fine-scale instruments capable of foreseen areas susceptible to deforestation. We will build analytical tools capable of revealing loggers' behavior, illegal logging sites, and deforestation and forest degradation dynamics over the years.

**Available Positions:**

- 1 Ph.D. position
- 2 Master positions

## PROJECT 3: Exploration and Analysis of Brazilian Legal Documents

_Funded by FGV/EMAp_

This project proposes to develop intelligent computational tools to support the identification, classification, and application (or non-application) of precedent bindings in higher and lower courts of the Brazilian judicial system. In addition, we intend to investigate the automatic extraction of relevant information from long legal documents by using modern natural language processing techniques, proposing new approaches and methodologies to help the justice system increase its efficiency.

**Available Positions:**

- 1 Ph.D. position
- 1 Master position

## Requirements

Applicants should have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Mathematics, or a related field. Candidates must have programming experience (Python, Javascript, HTML, or others). Knowledge of machine learning and data visualization is also desirable but not mandatory.

## How to Apply

- Applicants must apply via the following link by December 2, 2022: https://cacr.fgv.br/busca?loc=1&nivel=7&area=18
- For August 2023 intake, contact Prof. Jorge Poco to discuss opportunities
